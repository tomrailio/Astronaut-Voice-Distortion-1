1. Introduction 

This Use Case belongs to the primary Use Case category and is an instruction type of a model, where anyone can add hisher audiofile and play it with 
the "Astronaut voice distortion' functions, that is available in this repository.

Firstly, record your own audiofile, for example with your mobile device or laptop and fetch that (MP3, wav) file into the correct Matlab project file.

Secondly, choose which function you want to include with that audio file. You can also play your audio file in such a manner, that it uses both Mercury and Apollo
effects. In fact, this creates a cool reverberation like effect. Test it to find out :)

Thirdly, run the commands in the Matlab terminal and listen to your chosen parameter values and their effects. 

Fourthly, you can innovate your own implementations simply by just changing your own audio files and for more ideas, please see the general
description of the possible Use Cases.

If you come up with your own great ideas, please let us know and we will post them here for all.
